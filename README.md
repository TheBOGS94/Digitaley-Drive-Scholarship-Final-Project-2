## Data Analysis

#### First Question: Top Rated Restaurants
Best-Rated Dining Establishments
According to the average overall rating, the following restaurants are the highest rated:
San Luis Potosi's Emilianos - Average Rating: 2.0
Cuernavaca's Las Mañanitas Restaurant and San Luis Potosi's Michiko Restaurant Japones both have an average rating of 2.0.
San Luis Potosi's Cafe Punta Del Cielo has an average rating of 1.83.
San Luis Potosi's La Estrella De Dimas has an average rating of 1.8.
This is a comparison of the menus of highly regarded restaurants with the tastes of the general public:
Mexican food is highly favored by customers (97 preferences), and three of the best restaurants serve it. This suggests that the offerings of highly regarded restaurants and consumer preferences are highly aligned.
Cafeteria Style: Contains nine customer selections and can be found in a well regarded restaurant.
Although it isn't present in the top restaurants, American cuisine has eleven customer favorites.
Coffee shops and pizzerias are not among the top-rated eateries in our sample, although having some consumer preferences (9 and 8, respectively). According to this research, Mexican food is both very popular and frequently found in the highest-rated restaurants in this dataset, although other popular cuisines like American, pizza, and coffee shop are not always represented in these businesses.

#### Second Question: Demographics of Consumers
Analysis of Demographics: • Location: The bulk of customers (86 out of 138) are from San Luis Potosi; all customers are from Mexico. • Age: Extends from very young to very old. Specific Demographic Features Transportation Method: 42 drive a car, 14 walk, and 82 take public transit.
- Ten of them are married, while 124 are single.
- Children: 3 are dependent (living with parents), 11 have children, and 113 are independent (living with no children).
- Occupation: 16 work, 2 are unemployed, and 113 are students.
- The budgets of 91, 35, and 5 are medium, low, and high, respectively.
- Possible Prejudices and Insights • Age Distribution: Having customers in a variety of age groups offers a varied perspective, but precise information on age distribution would accentuate representativeness. • Geographic Concentration: Since all customers are from Mexico, primarily from San Luis Potosi, there is a geographic concentration that may restrict the applicability of the results to other areas or nations. • Marital Status and Children: A significant portion of the sample is composed of single people without children, which may have an impact on preferences for features that are geared toward families or menu items for kids.

#### Third Question: Gaps in Supply and Demand
- Cuisines That Are In High Demand But Hard to Find -Mexican cuisine: Only 28 restaurants offer it, despite 97 clients' high demand. This suggests a possible market opportunity for new or current restaurants to concentrate more on Mexican cuisine. 
- Coffee Shop: Only provided in one restaurant, but preferred by eight customers, suggesting a potential market niche for businesses that specialize on coffee.
- American Cuisine: There is only a 5 supply compared to an 11 demand, suggesting a potential undersupply. There are discernible gaps in the hot dog and family restaurant industries where there are more customers' preferences than there are establishments that can satisfy them. 
- Oversupplied Cuisines; Bar Cuisine 13 restaurants serve this type of food, but only 3 customers choose it, suggesting that the market may be oversaturated. 
- Brewery: One customer prefers it, although six restaurants provide it. - Fast food: Despite being popular and having five consumer preferences, eight places serve it, indicating a slight surplus.

#### Fourth Question: Features of Investments
- Important attributes: As you invest in a restaurant, ascertain which features are essential.
- Essential Elements of a Successful Alcohol Service in Restaurants: "Wine & Beer" restaurants typically receive better reviews, especially when they also have a no-smoking policy. Complete bars also usually do well, especially in enclosed spaces where parking is either valet or not available.
- Smoking Policy: Generally speaking, restaurants that do not permit smoking receive higher ratings than those that do. This suggests that the sampled customer base prefers smoke-free environments.
- Pricing Methodology: It's interesting to note that eateries with high and low prices receive excellent ratings, indicating that people respect both high-end and low-cost dining experiences. The medium price bracket usually has inconsistent results.
- Franchise vs. Independent: While both types of restaurants have the potential to receive excellent reviews, non-franchised establishments frequently hold the top rankings, indicating that distinctive independent eateries may have special attributes that appeal to patrons.
- Area and Parking: Higher ratings appear to be associated with closed spaces (which most likely indicate indoor dining) and the absence of parking or valet parking. This may indicate a desire for eating establishments that are thought to be more upscale or practical.
- Smokers: 26 of the consumers smoke, while 109 do not smoke.
- Drinking Level: Out of all consumers, 51 do not consume alcohol, 40 drink socially, and 47 drink occasionally.

### Recommendations for Strategy 

• Increasing Mexican and Coffee Shop Offerings: Given the strong demand and limited availability of these cuisines, businesses stand to gain from concentrating more on them.
• Reevaluating Investments in Bars and Breweries: Existing businesses may need to innovate or expand their services in order to draw in more clients, given their lower preference rates in comparison to supply.

### Summary and Conclusion
A customer survey was carried out in mexico city 2012 and the result showed that customers rated some resturanted high becuase of the sales of mexican foods. Though, american cuisines are also in demand. also, most of the customers are married from mexico city; San Luis Potosi to be precised. Also restaurant with no smoking policy got rated higher than restaurants with smoking policy. Finally restaurants with flexible pricings have high ratings too as it enables both the High class and the Low class to visit.
